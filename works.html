      <p>Throughout his lengthy career, Mills has become best known for his photorealistic paintings that delve into the realms of scenic scapes, as well as capturing still life. Throughout his early career, Mills took inspiration from his childhood in Martha Vineyard. He used mainly oil paints to interpret the sandy seascapes and New England Style Streets. As his art began to gain notoriety in major cities such as New York, Mills expanded the subjects of his scenic paintings to include more wildlife and more relatable work. Since then, he has created a name for himself in the art community for his still life paintings. Everyday objects and scenes suddenly become larger than life on his canvas. Below are some of his latest creations</p>
